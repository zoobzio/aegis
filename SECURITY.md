## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to the maintainers
3. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

We aim to respond to security reports within 48 hours and will work with you to understand and address the issue.
