# Overview

Aegis is a service mesh for Go microservices. Nodes discover each other, authenticate via mTLS, and call domain services—all without managing PKI infrastructure.

## The Idea

Microservices need secure communication. Traditional approaches require certificate authorities, key distribution, and rotation policies. Aegis asks: what if nodes could establish trust automatically?

When a node starts, it generates certificates. When nodes connect, they verify each other. The mesh handles topology—which nodes exist, which services they provide, where to route requests. You write domain logic; aegis handles transport security.

## The Implementation

Aegis provides:

- **Node** — Identity, lifecycle, and server management
- **Peer** — Connections to other nodes with mTLS
- **Topology** — Distributed view of mesh membership
- **Service Registry** — Declare services, discover providers
- **Service Client** — Connection pooling and load balancing
- **Health** — Extensible health checking

## What It Enables

Build distributed systems where:

- Services call each other without hardcoded addresses
- Every connection is authenticated and encrypted
- Topology changes propagate automatically
- Callers are identified on every request

Aegis is the transport layer for the zoobzio ecosystem:
